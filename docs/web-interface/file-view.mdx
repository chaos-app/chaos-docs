# File view

## Opening files

You can open files directly in the browser in new tabs. But you can view them in Chaos too!

To do so, simply select a file, and "Open in Chaos". You can do this from the context menu or a keyboard shortcut (`CTRL/CMD + O`).

Most links should be previewable in the web version. However, due to technical limitations, some links may not work. In this scenario, you should use the desktop app.

## Editing files

Click the ... icon to bring up the edit panel for the file. There, you can edit the name, add an icon/image and more.

## Split screen

You can select multiple files in the collection view and open them side by side. Each pane is resizeable. This is a valuable tool for working with multiple files without needing to context switch.
