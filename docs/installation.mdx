# Installation

## Web

Chaos is developed with modern web technologies and is accessible from any device which has a web browser. No installation is required. To start using Chaos, simply navigate to <https://makechaos.app>.

### Mobile

The web app is fully responsive and continuously optimized for mobile and touch devices. If you encounter trouble, please reach out to Chaos support.

## Desktop

We ship a version of Chaos as an alpha desktop app for macOS. This enables a few extra features (such as more robust web previews and experimental web extensions) but is by no means required to use Chaos. You can download the app from <https://makechaos.app/download>.

We plan on shipping Windows and Linux versions of the desktop app soon.

## Chrome extension

Chaos also has a web clipper extension for Google Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers). The web clipper lets you save any link to your Chaos collections without leaving the browser. You can download it from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chaos-web-clipper/ogcmnnaccndogbliiifmokdkfcmdaihi>.
