## Desktop

We ship a version of Chaos as an alpha desktop app for macOS. This enables a few extra features (such as more robust web previews and experimental web extensions) but is by no means required to use Chaos. You can download the app from <https://makechaos.app/download>.

We plan on shipping Windows and Linux versions of the desktop app soon.

## Chrome extension

Chaos also has a web clipper extension for Google Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers). The web clipper lets you save any link to your Chaos collections without leaving the browser. You can download it from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chaos-web-clipper/ogcmnnaccndogbliiifmokdkfcmdaihi>.
