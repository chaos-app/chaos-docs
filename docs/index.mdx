# Quick start

Welcome to Chaos! This documentation is a reference/manual for you to learn the in's and out's of Chaos. If you are new here, we recommend going through the 5 minute quick start below.

## Create an account and log in

Get started by **creating a new account**. You can do this by going to <https://makechaos.app/auth>. There, you will be prompted to either log in or create a new account.

## Create a new collection

Once you have logged in, you will be brought to the collections area: <https://makechaos.app/collections>. It will be empty. You can create a new collection by click the + icon in the sidebar.

## Add a link

Once you have made a new collection, click it in the sidebar to navigate to it. Now click the + icon in the collection view to add content. You can add links, images and most types of documents (with many more file types coming soon).

<img src={addLink} />
<br />
<br />

Chaos will fetch the link in the background and generate a rich preview for you. And voila! Your link should be saved to your collections. You can now start building your very own archive of knowledge with Chaos.
